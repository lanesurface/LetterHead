# LetterHead
Unfortunately there seems to be a discontinuity between good-looking ASCII images
and the options provided by free ASCII image generators. This is a quick took I
whipped up to solve the issue, bringing high-quality ASCII profile pictures
(AKA "LetterHeads") in a configurable manner. 

With this tool, you can choose the font, dimensions of your image, the characters
which are used to render it, and more. Download the jar file from the `Releases`
page and get crackin'!

Enjoy!
